# 1.3-A New Normal

The last several years have been defined by disruption. We have experienced a global pandemic, the return of full-scale national wars to Europe and a decline in globalization. We have also seen several structural changes to our economy which make the future much more uncertain and unpredictable.


The rise of remote working has fundamentally changed the nature of employment enabling more flexibility and choice for high-performing technology and finance professionals. Although some people believe the current economic slowdown and layoffs will allow management to force much of their workforce back into the office, the data tells a different story. The percentage of people working remotely has increased 600% between 2019 and 2022. As economic activity slows, remote working is likely to become more entrenched as it will allow employers to tap into larger labor markets and pay less for talent in less expensive geographies. Remote working is here to stay and companies need different technological and organizational capabilities in order to make it successful. This has resulted in a flood of billions of dollars into technologies that enable remote working. As these investments begin to bear fruit it will become easier and easier to work remotely.


In order to cope with the economic instability precipitated by the pandemic, the government injected trillions of dollars in stimulus into the economy. These initiatives supercharged the era of low interest rates and easy money that we have been enjoying since the end of the Great Financial Crisis and precipitated the historic bull run of 2021 and early 2022. Yet the era of easy money is over. Surging inflation has forced the federal reserve and other monetary authorities to raise interest rates at the fastest rate in history. Despite the current US federal interest rates of between 5.25% and 5.5%, inflation is very likely to remain stubbornly elevated for years to come. High inflation and high interest rates are an economic condition that we have not had to contend with in decades. It remains to be seen how companies and even industries cope with the higher cost of capital.


Finally, generative AI is poised to catalyze the greatest disruption to education and work since the invention of the internet. Since its release in November 2022 ChatGPT3 has passed the Wharton MBA exam, US medical licensing exam, Law School Exams and the Stanford Medical School clinical reasoning final just to name a few. Students are already using ChatGPT to generate school essays successfully. The author and psychologist Jordan Peterson[ asked ChatGPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jbBqBeKXcc) to generate a 13th rule for his bestselling book Beyond Order. According to him it was not obvious that he could have written it any better.


ChatGPT can already help to automate much of the minutiae of computer programming, writing and emails making current workers more productive and thereby destroying jobs in the process. While ChatGPT3 is a transformative technology, it is not ChatGPT3 that you should be worried about but ChatGPT30. Generative AI is improving by leaps and bounds and the development timelines for future versions of these programs are simultaneously shrinking. Eventually, these advances will reshape the way in which we work and learn. This means that we will experience continuous disruptions until the potential of this technology is fully realized.

Over the last 30 years, during the expansion of globalization, companies have prized efficiency above all else. We developed just-in-time supply chains and created that span the globe in an effort to wring every last drop of cost-savings out of our products.


The disruptions of the last several years have turned this paradigm on its head. Countries and companies alike have seen the peril of relying on so many foreign companies for components of vital products. For example, Covid exposed the stupidity of having the majority of the world's surgical masks made in the then somewhat obscure Chinese city of Wuhan. Rather than efficiency, companies must now attempt to build for resilience and flexibility. This is doubly true given the ongoing disruptions businesses must be prepared for.


#### Why is this important to web3?

These trends are important to web3 and the metaverse for two reasons.


First, web3 technologies like NFTs and cryptocurrencies enable new forms of organizations like Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that, properly implemented and led, can be much more flexible and adaptive than traditional organizations. In a world in which much of the workforce works remotely and flexibility has economic value we should expect some of these new types of web3 organizations to thrive and grow exponentially in value. That is not to say that all DAOs are valuable. In fact most are poorly organized and will likely go to 0. However, in a world of thousands of DAOs, it is those who operate cohesively and pursue effective goal-oriented actions that will attract additional members and capital, becoming more successful over time. These successful organizations will also likely inspire further DAOs to use similar governance strategies, thereby creating a type of digital evolution by natural selection.


Second, the billions of dollars in investment that companies are pouring into remote working and increasing the digital enablement of their businesses are expanding the total addressable market and accelerating the foundational technologies of the metaverse. All of the money being invested into enabling remote working, collaborative virtual spaces and VR headsets are helping to build out these technologies, lessening the amount of capital that will eventually be required to build a metaverse. This becomes especially true as many of the talented people working for technology and gaming companies leave to join existing web3 businesses or start their own. Over time we expect this trickle to become a flood as the incentives are significantly better for true experts in their field in web3 than in web2.


This is a very exciting time for the expanding web3 digital economy. Times of unprecedented disruption are also times of unparalleled opportunity. In the 19th and 20th centuries the railroads shrunk America. Distances that would have previously taken weeks to traverse now took days. These innovations changed the landscape of the American economy and made new business models possible. Consequently, many of today's most valuable companies were formed during this era.


We believe the present era is a comparable period of disruption.&#x20;


The internet has connected the vast majority of humanity via cyberspace. Yet much of the value created by the internet has been captured by a handful of gatekeepers. In the process the web has become siloed and centrally controlled, reducing its value. Web3 technologies offer a chance to change this. To reinvent the internet based on a more open architecture that prizes individual data sovereignty and is owned by its users and builders.


This is a book about the opportunity presented by web3 and the metaverse and how you can get involved. However, in order to understand the scope of the present opportunity and the types of businesses we think will flourish under the new web3 architecture we must first understand how we got here and what the Metaverse and web3 really are.&#x20;
