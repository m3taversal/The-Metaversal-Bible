# 1.1-A Metaversal Reality

First person viewpoint of someone using hypothetical capabilities built into a metaverse in 10 or 20 years. This section should emphasize how the Metaverse can contribute to greater human flourishing.

\


One of the most important aspects of the Metaverse is it will level the global economic playing field. People stuck in Afghanistan in the real world can work for Gucci in the metaverse. It will reduce racial inequality as people will be able to choose their avatars.&#x20;

\


I think a hypothetical narrative demonstrating these points might be a good way to open this book.&#x20;

\


As always open to suggestions.
