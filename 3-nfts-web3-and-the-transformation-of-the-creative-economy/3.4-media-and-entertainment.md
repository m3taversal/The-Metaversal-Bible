# 3.4-Media and Entertainment

Since their inception, moving pictures have captivated audiences, providing them with a unique ability to experience stories. The allure of cinema and television lies in their extraordinary ability to teleport viewers into distinct realms, stir emotions, and immerse them in riveting tales. Through the masterful fusion of cinematography, storytelling, performance, and sound, these mediums succeed in curating an immersive and transformative experience that wholly engages its audience.

\


Over the last half century, cinema and television have morphed into a universal dialect. They speak to something core in the human experience allowing them to transcend cultural boundaries and provide a platform for an incredible breadth and diversity of voices and stories to be echoed across the globe. These mediums champion empathy, stimulate social awareness, and provide an avenue to articulate and question societal norms, thereby fostering an environment conducive to cultural dialogue and comprehension. They possess profound cultural influence, mirroring and shaping our societal values, beliefs, and aspirations. They ignite discussions, confront norms, and forge shared experiences that unify individuals from an array of backgrounds.

\


The film and television industry also wield an immense economic influence, generating an impressive revenue stream and creating myriad job opportunities that bolster economic growth and development. An analysis by Morgan Stanley calculated that the global expenditure for TV and filmed entertainment content reached a staggering $150 billion in 2022. Another estimate by Ampere Analysis suggested content expenditure could be as high as $230 billion. Moreover, the industry likely generates even more extensive ancillary economic benefits beyond direct content spend.

\


The pivotal role stories play in sculpting cultural attitudes and consumer behavior also amplifies the global influence of films and television shows on various ancillary economic activities. These mediums stimulate tourism, inspire advertising, fuel merchandise sales, and forge licensing agreements, crafting opportunities for ancillary industries such as catering, equipment rentals, and post-production services. An all-encompassing study by OlsbergSPI in 2019 estimated the total economic impact of the screen sector at an astounding $414 billion.&#x20;

\


Despite the importance and value of film and TV, the businesses within the entertainment industry are experiencing a period of enormous disruption. Streamers, studios and key creative talent alike all dislike the new market dynamics and are looking for alternatives that can offer a better distribution of risk and reward within the industry. Web3 technologies have the potential to revolutionize the traditional business models for content creation, shifting towards a more fan-centered and collaborative entertainment ecosystem. Establishing entertainment franchises around NFTs allows creators to build direct relationships with their super fans. Additionally, it provides a strong foundation for creating the next generation of coherent multi-media franchises and investing in multi-purpose virtual assets that can be used in virtual production, games and metaverse experiences.&#x20;

\


Integrating NFTs and Web3 technologies into entertainment franchises can greatly enhance fan engagement. This integration not only empowers key creative talents with greater ownership but also significantly lowers risk for content purchasers.

\


Before delving into the unique value proposition that Film3 offers, it is essential to first understand the challenges that current entertainment industries are grappling with.

\


The Shifting Nature of Entertainment

The entertainment landscape today would be almost unrecognizable just 15 years ago. 15 years ago, the vast majority of consumers got their content through Pay-TV, TV box subscriptions that were extraordinarily difficult to cancel.&#x20;

\


Consumers were essentially content takers, watching whatever content was playing on their favorite channels.&#x20;

\


This setup allowed cable providers to bundle channels together, forcing customers to pay for a wide array of channels they never watched. Over time the price of Pay TV rose substantially faster than inflation as cable providers bundled ever more channels that viewers didn’t watch into their subscriptions.&#x20;

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wxLrjR\_eWcbp5mTRJfn-5JFT9oj9hK3JBh-VRJmrqATLCPDiuR3FhCw4k4hPxyPy\_jpOnIdjjzWKl99txN7ckxXtvfy9Q3iOwhW4fRFZvLvLUfbXzBqBnG2bn3K1xdNr5EIQRnWcb9KYcx\_LX6s9TYTGKhFsSNZP)

However, this move up market meant that many consumers were paying substantially more than they wanted to for a “better” product that far outstripped their needs. This created a vacuum at the lower end of the market for an innovative competitor to cater to price conscious consumers.&#x20;

\


This is exactly what Netflix did when it launched its streaming service in 2008 for just $8 a month (compared to the $80 cable TV providers were charging). In an effort to increase their divisions margins and earn higher bonuses, executives at all the major entertainment studios licensed their library content to Netflix, allowing Netflix to build a huge user base on the strength of external IP like Friends, the Office and NCIS.&#x20;

\


As Netflix gained more users and financial firepower they slowly moved up market and began producing original content like House of Cards. Simultaneously, Netflix focused relentlessly on improving the consumer experience offering customers instant on-demand access to a massive library of content from any device at premium quality.&#x20;

\


![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/MBVv\_Ghc9zlwj1j8URHzx6zuhwX\_np1JafM0ScyK4G1GErzw54UTdFY-Dg6R2XGZ9XJqFCYgL1pkgomuhQtAVackKWH7YlzjlEOFlIYFvulBIbZheHmAtxq-FgfgAfgRPYwEqGvEPUv5x6Y8zt-IemojPc8SwOgS)

\


Slowly entertainment incumbents began to wake up to the danger posed by Netflix. Finally, around 2018, the erosion of their core Pay TV business forced the entertainment companies like Disney, Warner Bros., and Paramount to pivot and try to emulate Netflix’s business model. This was the beginning of the Streaming Wars which saw these massive entertainment conglomerates invest tens of billions into building out their streaming platforms and securing a massive array of expensive original content to debut on their platforms.&#x20;

\


However, streaming has proven structurally less profitable than the Pay-TV business. Worse, the entrance of so many new platforms into the streaming market has shifted customer behavior undermining the business models of streaming platforms.&#x20;

\


During the excesses of the bull market of 2020 and 2021, Wall Street was laser focused on the holy grail of subscriber growth. Entertainment companies who exceeded consensus expectations of quarterly subscriber growth were rewarded with soaring stock prices while businesses that underperformed new subscriber expectations were punished. As a result, entertainment conglomerates incurred huge losses trying to reach scale and onboard more subscribers.&#x20;

\


However, as inflation and interest rates began to rise and stock prices suffered, investors began to turn their attention back to the profitability of the companies’ operations. It soon became apparent that the streaming market was not as lucrative as many executives and investors had at first hoped. This became abundantly clear in mid-2022 when Netflix reported its first quarterly subscriber loss in a decade, wiping out $55 billion in shareholder value and causing a massive fall in the stock prices of other streamers.&#x20;

\


One of the main problems streaming platforms face is that increased competition among streamers has increased costs and dramatically increased subscriber churn, dramatically worsening unit economics. All the major streamers are reducing their content budgets or holding them steady while they focus on reducing their operating losses. Yet with the exception of Netflix (as well as Apple and Amazon, who can afford to treat their entertainment offerings as loss leaders for their ecosystems) all the major streaming platforms are subscale and losing billions of dollars on operations. In 2022, the four largest traditional media companies, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount and Comcast (NBCU), collectively lost $10 billion on their streaming efforts. Paramount and NBCU expect these losses to accelerate in 2023.

\


It turns out that when consumers have a multitude of subscription options to choose from, many begin to actively manage their entertainment expenditure and cycle between subscriptions, depending on the content currently available on different platforms. These serial churners create a huge problem for the streamers business models as Doug Shapiro eloquently describes in his Medium article “To Everything, Churn, Churn, Churn.”&#x20;

\

\


Market data now indicates that streaming households subscribe to an average of around 4 streaming platforms. There are currently 8 or so major streamers. In such an environment it is unclear when or even if many of these existing streamers will ever achieve profitability.&#x20;

\


![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ycokInW3E-ovSEnFYhk\_r7Oq08QdZK0E5HkRmUzGJ6lfOZt4hXDodWmweiIfZg7VB\_e7YexJZQBVBhSewBUESefWjETNK0PgnK60CtwTuHUEpAiqwcrssNL91Wfo7yUqaQlBMtb3NccCITCU9bKO\_1dmSOxrCJkv)

Studios and content creators are also unhappy with the current market dynamics. Broadly the entertainment industry faces a couple main problems that are very difficult to solve from within the entertainment industry that make it ripe for disruption.&#x20;

\


A Crisis in the Entertainment Industry&#x20;

The entertainment industry is facing a number of simultaneous problems that are proving hugely disruptive and difficult to solve.&#x20;

\


This state of affairs increases the likelihood that the entertainment industry will undergo an inflection point and be forced to shift to a new model of entertainment creation and monetization.

\


First, the old entertainment business model is unwinding.&#x20;

After a couple years of irrational euphoria over the promise of streaming, entertainment executives are waking up to the fact that streaming is nowhere near as profitable as the traditional TV bundle. Additionally, the shift towards streaming has massively heightened competition in the entertainment industry.

\


One of the most annoying features of pay TV bundles is how difficult they are to cancel. Customers were essentially locked in, providing a steady stream of revenue. Streaming has radically changed this dynamic. Consumers now pay month to month and it is very easy to cancel or pause a subscription. Thus streamers are forced to constantly provide new amazing shows and movies to retain their subscriber base.&#x20;

\


Second, entertainment companies face increasing risk.&#x20;

Recent changes in the entertainment industry have drastically increased the risk for entertainment companies and creatives alike.&#x20;

\


The rise of streaming dramatically disrupted the profit models of creatives within the entertainment industry. Prior to streaming, most key creative talents’ compensation consisted of up front fees and backend participation. These arrangements meant that key talent only got paid the smaller fixed fees on their unsuccessful projects and earned huge returns on their blowout successes through profit sharing.&#x20;

\


Continuing royalties from successful movies like Jaws or Jurassic park allowed successful creatives to set up their own production houses for future movies rather than working as a producer or director for hire.&#x20;

\


All this changed with the rise of cost-plus deals. With streaming it is much more difficult to split the financial rewards of success with creatives since doing so requires streamers to determine how much individual titles contributed to their subscription revenue. These efforts are further complicated by the fact that streamers are extremely reluctant to share data about viewing behaviors and consumer trends with third parties.&#x20;

\


As such, when Netflix began financing its own original content they relied exclusively on cost-plus deals which would pay producers a 15-25% premium over the cost of their movie in exchange for Netflix owning that content in perpetuity, effectively buying out the creators backend participation.&#x20;

\


This model has become much more widespread in the last 5 years as Netflix expanded and other entertainment companies shifted into streaming. However, cost-plus deals present a number of problems that are exacerbating the current crisis in entertainment.&#x20;

\


Cost plus deals have massively disrupted the distribution of risk and reward in the entertainment industry, increasing costs and correspondingly risks for content buyers and disempowering creatives in the process.&#x20;

\


Many creative professionals hate cost plus deals, as they feel a diminished sense of agency given they no longer share ownership in their projects and possess limited control over their intellectual property. This shift has impacted essential industry figures including writers, producers, and directors, who now find themselves functioning as employees of distribution firms rather than as co-owners of their creative endeavors.&#x20;

\


“We are in a golden age of content production and the dark age of creative profit sharing.”&#x20;

* Jeff Sagansky, former President of CBS Entertainment and Sony Pictures Entertainment

\


“If you are looking to build wealth and/or explore boundless storytelling, then working with a streamer would be akin to creative sharecropping. You don’t own the land or even decide what is grown on it, you just get to eat off it.”

* Christopher Tuffin, producer

\


“We are experiencing the ‘Uberification’ of the industry.”

* James Schamus, Oscar-nominated writer and producer

\


Cost plus deals also massively increase the costs for streamers. By “paying an upfront flat fee, Netflix buys out the usual success-based incentive compensation (known as the back end in Hollywood),” explains prolific horror producer Jason Blum. “This effectively treats every creator as part of a hit movie or TV show before the camera ever rolls. An actor who might typically make a million dollars upfront with a healthy backend if the film does well will instead get $3m up front and no back end participation. This system makes the business of movie and TV show producing very expensive.”

\


This shift in risk distribution combined with the increased competition among streamers to develop ever more expensive tent pole franchises to attract new subscribers to their platform and retain existing ones explain why TV show budgets have been ballooning in recent years.&#x20;

\


![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pYBM8Bo8Wb0oPRPbnv0mPXHLbtY6OjLtdoUeeh\_k4j8swkPqm6rAiIVCgNOL-HdSJ18k5MKTN5yltEOHk6OJjoAsvJcb2uCnPorRtJAQislWI-0WQPwXtrmv0PrfB6PVoe0\_ArV9seNnDC4piJKC-MYd1tpsOEkQ)

\


Similarly, the median budget of premium live action films has also been steadily climbing.

\


![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OaTJvnldGIYQomdE296ljdPGcte04DynuIchDwD6cRet\_Xv6YWh29worj6Lhf-pcjaFZ2OwXPBPlxnS7fbMctD2zq8K4SF30qmb3Wxb-hvYtQap5cDTeLiQVOnuogeWf\_Dn-ayFvgvfUGo9N\_jybbVQdrOcWfypI)

\


A significant issue with cost-plus deals is that they inflate expenses while simultaneously diminishing quality. Paying key creative talent a fixed fee with no profit-based incentives is an ineffective method to spur them to go above and beyond as their compensation remains unchanged, regardless of the effort they put in to elevate the quality of their work.

\


Another factor contributing to increased risk within the entertainment industry is a profound structural shift. As our economy globalizes and digitalizes, success has become largely contingent on virality. Consequently, the most successful TV shows and movies reach unprecedented heights of popularity, leading to a surge in indie films and user-generated content. However, this trend is leaving a void in the sector of medium-budget movies, which are progressively being edged out.

\


The cumulative effect of all these dynamics is a significant increase in risk. TV shows and movies are costing more and the volatility of returns is increasing.&#x20;

\


Content producers and buyers are in desperate need of a way to reduce their risk.&#x20;

\


Third, the emerging technology shoe has yet to drop

We stand on the cusp of a technological revolution in the industry, as the full potential of emerging technologies has yet to be realized.&#x20;

\


This metaphorical "shoe has yet to drop" represents a looming transformation that could drastically reshape the current paradigm. An array of state-of-the-art innovations, including but not limited to generative AI and virtual production, are poised to dramatically disrupt the cost-structure of the entertainment landscape. This disruption will transcend mere cost-saving measures, ushering in a new era of creative possibilities and operational efficiencies.

\


These cutting-edge technologies offer an incredible opportunity for the most prolific and talented creatives, such as writers, directors, and animators, to amplify their output. They allow for the enhancement of both quantity and quality, enabling the automation of certain aspects of production without compromising artistic integrity.

\


Over the next 5 to 10 years, the increasing integration of these technologies into the media and entertainment industry is forecasted to have a profound impact. It is likely to result in significant job losses, especially in areas where repetitive and time-consuming tasks can be streamlined or fully replaced by sophisticated algorithms.

\


The automation of these functions is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can foster a more streamlined and economically sustainable production environment, paving the way for further innovation and creative exploration. On the other hand, it raises serious questions about the future of employment within the industry and necessitates careful consideration of social, ethical, and economic implications.

\


Additionally, the advancement of tools for user-generated content, working in tandem with generative AI, is poised to ignite a more intense competition within the industry. As these technologies evolve, the barriers to creating high-quality video content are gradually eroding, leveling the playing field for both established creators and newcomers. This democratization of production capability opens the door for greater innovation and diversity of content, but also sets the stage for a highly competitive environment where excellence and differentiation will become paramount.

\


The Crisis in Hollywood

These challenges strike at the very heart of the prevailing business models of streaming platforms and represent persistent obstacles that are unlikely to be resolved in the near future. Complicating matters further, contentious issues such as limited backend compensation, stagnant pay rates, and the controversial role of generative AI in entertainment have ignited a profound rift between Hollywood studios and creative professionals.

\


This discord has culminated in the first double strike by writers and actors since 1960, effectively bringing the industry to a standstill. Tensions are running high, and the complexity of the underlying disagreements makes a quick and successful resolution of the strike elusive. The industry finds itself at a critical crossroads, navigating uncharted territory where collaboration and compromise are essential yet seem out of reach. The lingering uncertainty threatens not only the immediate future of entertainment production but also calls into question the sustainability of current practices and relationships within the industry.

\


In an effort to restore investor confidence and halt their plunging stock prices many media businesses have embarked on huge cost cutting measures. Disney has announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs as part of a $5.5 billion dollar cost cutting initiative. Warner Bros. Discovery is currently attempting to ring $4 billion in cost-cutting synergies after a recent merger. Often it is new divisions exploring unproven ideas that get cut first. For example, Disney’s metaverse unit was fired in the first wave of job cuts.&#x20;

\


Beyond mere cost savings, entertainment businesses are trying to pursue more predictable revenues. This has led to a massive increase in the number of sequels and a decrease in original content. Paramount plus is moving away from creating original animated IP in favor of licensing preexisting IP from Nickelodeon.&#x20;

\


This makes sense. Media and entertainment companies are playing defensive and trying to bet on sure things. After all, “A wealth of economic data points to the fact that the film industry is a failure-driven business, not a “hit-driven” business, as practitioners tend casually to refer to it” explains Arthur De Vany in Hollywood Economics. Yet by relying increasingly on sequels and removing much originality from these studios, studios are worsening the problems of the entertainment industry.&#x20;

\


Pumping out franchise sequels to meet shareholder demands always worsens the quality of these projects, diluting the brand. The recent history of Marvel, Mission Impossible, the DC Universe, Star Wars, and Indiana Jones provide ample examples of this. Viewers are getting superhero fatigue from the increased quantity and decreasing quality of random superhero movies that are pumped out every year.&#x20;

\


What Hollywood is desperately in need of is an intelligent way of incubating content that keeps the cost down and comes with a dedicated core audience thereby decreasing risk.&#x20;

\


Coincidentally, this is exactly what Web3 can provide.

\


The Role of Web3 in Entertainment&#x20;

\


Web3 technologies are a game-changer for creators and independent production studios that promise to revolutionize the way content is incubated, financed, and engaged with. With web3, creators are empowered to incubate content from a diverse range of cultures more efficiently, at a reduced cost, and with fewer resources.

\


One of the significant challenges faced by filmmakers and content creators in the traditional entertainment industry is the lack of a direct relationship with their audience. The long value chain and traditional IP development process make it practically impossible for creators to obtain audience feedback, solicit support, and build a dedicated fanbase. However, web3 changes this landscape by providing creators with a platform to foster vibrant communities, secure funding for their intellectual property development, and offer their audience a financial stake in the success of the project.

\


Web3 technology allows content studios and creators to raise capital through NFT sales or security tokens, providing an alternative and decentralized funding model. By tokenizing their IP, creators can engage with the audience early on and obtain valuable feedback during the development stage. This enables them to refine their content based on the community's preferences and interests, ensuring a stronger connection between the creators and their fanbase.

\


Moreover, integrating NFTs into an entertainment franchise strengthens brand loyalty by creating a sense of ownership and emotional attachment among collectors. Through NFTs, holders become investors in the entertainment franchise they love, giving them the opportunity to participate in the development process, provide feedback, and see their ideas be incorporated into the IP universe. This interactive and fulfilling experience builds a dedicated and engaged fanbase that can serve as advocates, generating word-of-mouth marketing and strengthening the negotiating position of the creators with studios and streaming platforms.

\


Web3 also helps reduce costs and risks by securitizing backend participation. By offering key talent backend participation through blockchain technology, creators can align incentives and share the financial rewards, making the overall production process more cost-effective and efficient.

\


This new approach to incubating content in the web3 ecosystem provides creators with valuable market feedback, builds a dedicated fanbase early on, and reduces financial risk. It also maximizes the potential upside by showcasing the strength of the IP and the core audience base when pitching to studios and streaming platforms. The success of projects such as Claynosaurz, Pudgy Penguins, and the Fracture demonstrates the potential of web3 in transforming the entertainment industry, fostering inclusivity, interactivity, and economic empowerment for creators and their audience alike.

\


Building Audience-Centric Entertainment Franchises

In today's entertainment landscape, audiences play an increasingly important role in the success of entertainment franchises. With the advent of social media and the rise of viral reactions and memes, audiences have the power to make or break a franchise. Some of the most popular franchises are able to break out of their niche and become part of the cultural zeitgeist. These franchises soon dominate conversations at school, trend online, and even become the subject of chatter around workplace watercoolers. This burgeoning popularity magnetizes individuals. Even those who haven’t yet tuned into the show feel compelled to do so, fueled by a desire to decode the inside jokes and share in the sense of community bonding.

\


"Squid Game," "Stranger Things," "Game of Thrones,” and “The Mandalorian” are great examples of this. These franchises all benefited from word-of-mouth recommendations and viral social media posts that enabled them to transcend the typical viewers of their genre and attract a more mainstream audience. Through their popularity and the support of a fanatical fan base, these shows evolved into global cultural phenomena that attract hundreds of millions of viewers.&#x20;

\


"Squid Game," a South Korean survival drama series, gained global attention through social media buzz and viral marketing. Its unique concept, intense competition, and thought-provoking social commentary resonated with audiences. The show's viral success drew people in, transcending language and cultural barriers, as they wanted to be part of the shared experience and join the conversations happening online and offline.

\


Similarly, "Stranger Things" tapped into nostalgia for 1980s pop culture and blended it with compelling storytelling and memorable characters. The show's ability to evoke a sense of nostalgia while appealing to a broad range of audiences made it a must-watch series. Its viral success can be attributed to social media discussions, viral marketing campaigns, and the desire to be part of the collective experience surrounding the show.

\


"Game of Thrones" also experienced widespread popularity, particularly in its early seasons. Seasons 1 to 7 garnered a devoted fan base that eagerly followed the political intrigues, epic battles, and shocking twists within the world of Westeros. The series became a cultural phenomenon, discussed not only among avid fantasy fans but also among casual viewers who were drawn in by the hype and buzz surrounding the show. The viral discussions, debates, and memes surrounding "Game of Thrones" created a sense of community and shared experience, compelling people to tune in and be part of the phenomenon.

\


Indeed, the double-edged sword of viral reactions is not to be underestimated. Television shows and movies can find themselves riding the wave of popularity or sinking under the weight of adverse viral reactions. The fan base, being the lifeblood of a franchise, holds the power to uplift or dismantle it, their reactions echoed and amplified through online platforms.

\


Take "Game of Thrones Season 8," "Star Wars: The Last Jedi," "Halo," "The Rings of Power," and "The Witcher," for instance. These franchises serve as potent examples of the extent of damage that can be inflicted when the core audience perceives a disconnect between the creators and the community feedback. When fans feel their beloved source material has been trivialized, or when they witness the disintegration of their favorite characters, the fallout can be catastrophic.

\


These instances underscore the importance of creative teams genuinely engaging with and taking cues from audience feedback. They serve as a stark reminder that deviation from the source material and tampering with cherished characters can lead to significant discontent among the fan base. This can manifest as a wave of negative viral reactions capable of dealing a severe blow to the franchise's reputation and success.

\


In the new era of audience-first entertainment franchises, NFTs offer a unique opportunity to strengthen the relationship between creators and their fanbase. Through NFTs, fans can transition from passive spectators to active stakeholders in their favorite franchises, harmonizing their interests with those of the creative team. This inherently makes more sense than fans of traditional entertainment franchises behaving like investors with no real stake in the franchise. The ownership of NFTs allows fans to feel a sense of ownership and participation, driving their motivation to contribute positively to the franchise's growth.

\


Furthermore, NFTs enable creators to engage with their fanbase on a deeper level. By leveraging NFTs, creators can solicit feedback from the community, involve fans in the development process, and incorporate their ideas and input into the franchise. This interactive and inclusive approach fosters a stronger sense of community and empowers fans to become active participants in shaping the future of the franchise.

\


Moreover, the viral nature of these entertainment franchises becomes amplified through NFTs. As fans proudly display their digital collectibles and participate in the ownership of NFTs, they generate further interest and curiosity among their peers. This word-of-mouth promotion, coupled with the viral nature of social media, helps spread awareness and attract new viewers to the franchise. The NFTs serve as badges of belonging and create a sense of exclusivity, encouraging fans to share their enthusiasm and passion with others.

\


The prerequisites for a successful entertainment franchise are evolving, with the necessity for creators to cultivate intimate relationships with their core fan bases becoming more evident. The superhero era, once a dominant force in popular culture, is waning. Audiences have grown weary of the slew of annual superhero movies, often marred by increasingly dubious plotlines and character arcs. The blueprint for a successful entertainment franchise in the 2020s will significantly diverge from the previous decade's formula.

\


Creators, despite their expertise, don’t have all the answers. Many industry professionals, even in Hollywood, struggle to identify the appropriate questions to consider. Amid this prevailing uncertainty, forging close connections and maintaining open dialogues with a franchise's devoted fans are paramount. These interactions are crucial for creators to understand and act upon their fans' feedback, thereby enhancing their prospects of crafting a valuable franchise.

\


The next franchise of Marvel's magnitude will likely not just be confined to long-form video content but will incorporate elements from the gaming industry and metaverse experiences. Web3 collectors, often well-versed in these technologies and ecosystems, can offer invaluable insights. As entertainment brands begin to explore these nascent industries, they would benefit immensely from tapping into the knowledge and perspectives of these collectors.

\


Coherent Multi-media Foanchises

The entertainment industry is witnessing a seismic shift, characterized by the convergence of distinct mediums such as movies, TV shows, and video games into a more fluid and intertwined landscape. This transformation is reshaping how audiences consume, interact with, and perceive entertainment.

\


In the past, these forms of entertainment were largely siloed. Movies and TV shows were primarily passive experiences, where viewers watched narratives unfold on screen. Games, on the other hand, provided an active experience, allowing players to control and shape narratives in the virtual realm.

\


The advent of technology, particularly the rise of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and cloud gaming, has brought about the potential for these mediums to overlap and merge. Now, the traditionally passive experience of watching a movie or TV show can be transformed into an interactive one. Instead of merely watching characters, viewers can assume the roles of these characters, make decisions that influence the narrative, and interact with the storyworld in a tangible way, almost akin to gaming.

\


Take the concept of "transmedia storytelling," for instance, where the narrative unfolds across multiple media platforms, each contributing uniquely to the user's understanding of the story. A TV series might lay the groundwork for the main plot, a companion video game could explore a subplot or the backstory of a character, and an AR app could offer an immersive experience that lets users interact with the story's environment.

\


Similarly, the rise of the metaverse—a virtual reality space where users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users—also points towards this convergence. The metaverse offers the potential for movies, TV shows, and games to coexist and integrate in one space, providing a holistic and interactive entertainment experience.

\


These developments indicate that the future of entertainment will likely be less about isolated, individual experiences and more about multi-platform, immersive, and interactive narratives. As we move forward, the delineation between gaming and other forms of entertainment will continue to blur, leading to a more integrated and engaging entertainment landscape.

\


In this new environment, it is crucial for entertainment franchises to approach their development with a more deliberate and careful strategy, focusing on building a strong foundation for each pillar of the franchise.

\


The traditional Hollywood approach to franchise expansion has been characterized as “Trickle-Down Transmedia.” Success of a movie would prompt studios to rapidly cash in on its profitability through sequels. However, this rush often compromised the quality of storytelling and plot compared to the original. This was especially evident in video games, animated series, and TV shows, often produced by different teams, leading to a sense of disconnection from the original intellectual property. Franchises like Jaws, Terminator, Ghostbusters, Alien, and Jurassic Park illustrate this phenomenon. This method often diluted the franchise's value and alienated fans.

\


In contrast, today's device-agnostic world, where audiences engage with various entertainment forms on the same platforms, calls for a unified effort to utilize the convergence of these mediums effectively. Modern successful franchises, such as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, have adopted an integrated storytelling approach. By harmonizing their different platforms, they foster a cohesive and immersive experience for fans.

\


Yet, even flourishing franchises like Marvel have struggled to balance Disney's insatiable demand for more content against the vital requirement of maintaining high production quality. Lately, this equilibrium seems to have faltered, with numerous average TV shows and subpar movies like "Antman: Quantumania" and "Thor: Love and Thunder" entering the fray. The ensuing deluge of mediocre content, costing billions of dollars, has tarnished the brand's reputation. As a result, Disney is now refocusing on producing fewer, high-quality shows and movies in the future. This shift underscores the importance of a calculated and intentional approach when building the next generation of multimedia franchises.

\


To succeed in this evolving landscape, entertainment franchises must prioritize foresight, strategic planning, and careful execution. By building each pillar of the franchise with intention and ensuring a cohesive and high-quality experience across different platforms, creators can engage and captivate audiences, fostering long-term success and creating a lasting impact in the ever-changing entertainment industry.

\


NFTs and web3 communities are poised to play a pivotal role in the design of synergistic and coherent multimedia franchises, particularly within the fantasy and science fiction genres. This emerging approach holds great significance for streaming platforms, as blockbuster, platform-defining TV shows and movies have become increasingly vital in attracting and retaining users.

\


Notably, shows like Game of Thrones and Stranger Things played instrumental roles in the success of HBO and Netflix, respectively. These platforms became must-have subscriptions because of their flagship series which differentiated them from the rest of the market. Similarly, the Marvel Cinematic Universe and The Mandalorian have been integral to the success of Disney+. Recognizing the significance of these flagship franchises, competing streaming platforms, including Apple, Amazon, and Paramount Plus, have invested heavily in projects like Foundation, The Rings of Power, The Wheel of Time, and Halo.

\


The significance of these shows is further emphasized by Jeff Bezos' statement, "I want my Game of Thrones," which has influenced Amazon's substantial investments in The Rings of Power and The Wheel of Time. Roy Price, the former head of Amazon Studios, highlighted the impact of these blockbuster shows, noting that big shows are essential in moving the needle and inspiring others in the industry. He compared the impact of Game of Thrones to that of Jaws and Star Wars in the movie industry, stating that it serves as a model for a hit TV show. Amazon, being a behemoth in the streaming world, possesses a unique vantage point to make these assessments. Numerous third-party streaming platforms vend their subscriptions through the Amazon Video marketplace, furnishing Amazon with an extensive dataset outlining detailed streaming behaviors.

\


In this landscape, exceptional shows that generate buzz and capture public attention are the true focus for streaming platforms. The competition lies not in broad acceptance but in delivering exceptional content. Franchises like Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar, and Game of Thrones exemplify the immense value these expansive universes, high-quality plots, and compelling characters can bring to studios.

\


While the complexity of certain science fiction and fantasy stories has hindered their adaptation to the big screen, recent advancements in generative AI offer promising solutions. These advancements have the potential to significantly reduce the cost of content creation, particularly for high-budget productions with extensive virtual special effects. As a result, producing exceptional science fiction and fantasy content becomes more viable and valuable.

\


The content incubation approach described earlier is uniquely suited to bring these entertainment franchises to life. A producer or studio could acquire the film rights to a captivating science fiction or fantasy book and leverage it to develop a collection of 10,000 NFTs. By selling these NFTs, they can raise a few million dollars while simultaneously building a dedicated community around the IP. These funds can be invested in developing essential components of a Hollywood pitch package, such as scripts, bibles, and loglines. Moreover, decentralized IP concepts described earlier can be integrated, allowing NFT holders to compete and contribute to script improvement in exchange for rewards, recognition, and incremental ownership of the IP. Additionally, allocating resources to create iconic buildings, places, and landscapes from the books further immerses holders in the fictional world.

\


Successful implementation of this approach would result in a large and passionate community united around the IP. This community-driven support strengthens studios' positions when pitching projects to streamers, as it offers an expansive universe with potential for follow-on TV shows and movies, backed by an existing core audience base. Ultimately, the convergence of NFTs, web3 communities, and the content incubation model presents an exciting opportunity to revolutionize the way multimedia franchises are designed, developed, and embraced by audiences in the modern entertainment landscape.

Media and the Metaverse

Media franchises like Marvel, Star Wars, and Game of Thrones have the potential to become exponentially more valuable in the context of the metaverse for several reasons.

\


Firstly, these franchises have already established massive and dedicated fan bases around the world. These fans have a deep emotional connection to the characters, stories, and worlds created within these franchises. As the metaverse aims to provide immersive and interactive experiences, leveraging the existing fan base of these franchises can drive significant engagement and participation within their respective metaverses. This built-in fan base ensures a ready and enthusiastic audience, making the metaverse more vibrant and exciting.

\


Secondly, these franchises possess expansive and well-developed universes that offer a wealth of content, characters, and storylines. This richness provides a solid foundation for creating diverse and immersive metaverses. The metaverse can bring these universes to life in ways that extend beyond traditional media formats, allowing fans to explore, interact, and engage with their favorite characters, settings, and narratives. The metaverse can offer unique experiences and opportunities for fans to be a part of these beloved franchises, enhancing their value and appeal.

\


Moreover, the metaverse's ability to blend virtual and real-world elements opens up new avenues for monetization and ownership. Fans can own and trade virtual assets tied to these franchises, such as collectibles, virtual real estate, or even virtual representations of iconic characters. True ownership adds a new layer of value and engagement to the metaverse experience, as fans can express their fandom, showcase their assets, and participate in a thriving virtual economy.

\


Furthermore, the metaverse's potential as a collection of microverses allows for specialized and tailored experiences centered around specific entertainment franchises. A Marvel metaverse, for example, can immerse fans in a world filled with superheroes, epic battles, and interconnected storylines. Similarly, a Game of Thrones metaverse can offer fans a chance to explore the intricate politics, rich history, and iconic locations of Westeros. This focus on specific franchises ensures that each microverse provides an authentic and engaging experience for fans, catering to their unique interests and passions.

\


In summary, media franchises like Marvel, Star Wars, and Game of Thrones bring immense value to the metaverse due to their dedicated fan bases, rich universes, and potential for interactive and immersive experiences. Their inclusion in the metaverse ensures a captivating and dynamic environment that attracts and engages fans, making the overall metaverse experience far more compelling. These franchises contribute to the metaverse's appeal and help create a diverse collection of microverses, each offering unique and exciting opportunities for fans to explore and own assets within their favorite entertainment worlds.

\


Incorporating NFTs from the beginning is instrumental in developing entertainment franchises into metaversal brands and offers significant upside in a cost-plus dominated industry.

\


By maintaining the metaverse and gaming rights for the stories we develop, we unlock the potential of successful franchises beyond traditional TV shows or movies. Profits generated from these media can be reinvested into expanding the corresponding virtual worlds, enhancing their immersive potential and creating a seamless integration between the narrative-driven content and the interactive metaverse experience.

\


The initial funding for franchise development can come from digital collectible (NFT) holders. These early supporters can receive airdropped tokens, enabling them to participate in bidding for in-game assets and locations. Imagine owning Stark Tower, Mjolnir or an Iron Man suit and being able to use those assets in the Marvel Metaverse. &#x20;

\


Integrating NFTs and Web3 communities from the outset simplifies the process of adapting intellectual property for a story-driven metaverse experience. The inherent liquidity and programmability of NFTs make it easier to create dynamic and malleable virtual realities, where real people can actively participate and shape the narrative landscape.

\


This approach not only breathes new life into established IPs but also transforms them from static creations into living, evolving virtual worlds that engage users on multiple levels. The future of metaverses holds the potential for seamless transitions between different franchise-based realms, allowing users to traverse between Lord of the Rings, Marvel, Star Wars, and more, creating a unified metaverse experience.

\


Overall, this methodology offers a powerful means to bootstrap metaverse and entertainment franchises through crowdfunding and NFTs, mitigating financial risks and unlocking asymmetric upside potential. It establishes a symbiotic relationship between the franchise creators, the passionate fanbase, and the evolving metaverse landscape, ensuring continued innovation, engagement, and value creation for all stakeholders involved.
