# 3.2-Books and Publishing
Storytelling holds a profound and enduring significance in human culture. Since the dawn of civilization, storytelling has served as a powerful tool for communication, connection, and understanding. Through the art of storytelling, we share experiences, convey knowledge, and shape our collective identity. Stories have the ability to captivate, inspire, and provoke emotions, allowing us to explore the depths of the human condition. They provide a framework for interpreting the world around us, fostering empathy and promoting understanding across diverse cultures and generations. From ancient myths and legends to modern novels and films, storytelling weaves the fabric of our existence, preserving our history, transmitting values, and igniting our imagination. It is through storytelling that we explore our dreams, confront our fears, and make sense of our place in the vast tapestry of existence.&#x20;


However, while storytelling is valued and cherished, the reality for many writers is the arduous challenge of making a sustainable living from their craft.&#x20;


The traditional publishing landscape has undergone significant transformations. The consolidation of major publishing houses, the shift towards digital media, and the rise of self-publishing have reshaped the industry. While these changes have opened up new avenues for writers, they have also increased competition and put pressure on authors to navigate the complexities of marketing and self-promotion.


Furthermore, the financial rewards of writing can be limited, particularly for emerging or midlist authors. Royalty rates, advances, and revenue sharing models vary widely, and it can be challenging to earn a substantial income solely from writing. Many writers supplement their income through other means, such as teaching, freelancing, or pursuing related creative endeavors.


Despite these challenges, writers continue to persevere, driven by their passion for storytelling. They understand the intrinsic value of their craft and the impact their words can have on readers. While the road to success may be difficult, dedicated writers find solace in the power of their stories to inspire, enlighten, and entertain.


Additionally, the advent of digital technologies and the rise of self-publishing platforms have provided writers with greater control over their work and the potential to reach wider audiences. Through avenues like e-books, blogs, and social media, writers can connect directly with readers and bypass traditional gatekeepers.


The rise of crowdfunding platforms and the emergence of web3 technologies, such as NFTs, hold promise for creating alternative funding models and empowering writers to monetize their work in innovative ways. These developments present new opportunities for writers to cultivate a dedicated fanbase, secure direct support from their readers, and retain a larger portion of the profits generated by their creative endeavors.


The value of crowdfunding through NFTs and decentralized books becomes more apparent when we examine the difficulties authors face with the traditional publishing industry.


Why the Traditional Publishing Industry Sucks
The traditional book publishing industry has not changed substantially since the 1990s despite the advent of the internet and the rise of Amazon. The industry operates as an oligopoly that has in fact become more concentrated over the last several decades through a series of M&A transactions.


Today, 5 global publishing companies control 90% of the anticipated top-selling books. This industry concentration decreases the leverage authors have and leaves them with lower pay & benefits.


The global publishing industry suffers from several other problems. Here are a few examples of those problems.


The industry moves slowly. It can take weeks or months for authors to hear back after submissions. And that’s just acquisition. Getting your book into print can take up to two years.


Outdated Economic Model. Despite the increased accessibility on the customer's end, authors typically only receive 5–20% of a book’s royalties after the advance has been repaid.


Complicated and Opaque Industry Structure with Multiple Gatekeepers. Authors need to hire agents to pitch their manuscript to publishing houses. Those agents typically take 15% of the author's net pay. Authors also need an acquiring editor, and editors usually assign prereaders to pre-approve submitted content. Even if the editor loves your manuscript, they still must sell it to the rest of the team. This complexity creates an opaque approval process in which books often get rejected for unknown reasons.


The Traditional Publishing Process is Rife with Discrimination. The 2020 study Rethinking ‘Diversity’ in Publishing, found that writers of color do not receive the same industry access, creative freedoms, or economic value as white counterparts. Black writers with large followings frequently get paid 3 to 10 times less than white authors with smaller followings.


Outdated Marketing Strategies. Publishing houses have large marketing budgets and strong relationships with bookstores, online reviewers and media outlets. However, their marketing strategies have not changed substantially since the 1980s.


Even so, Publishing houses typically only use these resources for books they believe can be bestsellers. This leaves most indie authors having to self-promote their content while still paying a huge percentage of their economics to publishers.


The Rise of Self-publishing
The difficulty and poor economics offered by the publishing industry have led a huge number of authors to self-publish. The self-publishing industry began in 2007 with Amazon’s self-publishing innovation, Kindle Direct Publishing. In 2011, at least 148k books and 87k eBooks were self-published. By 2017, the total number of self-published books had grown to 1.5 million.


Self-publishing is no longer restricted to niche books or authors who couldn’t make it in traditional publishing. Certain self-published books witness extraordinary levels of success. A few examples: The Martian, Fifty Shades of Grey, Eragon, Rich Dad Poor Dad and Still Alice.


Self-publishing allows authors to move faster, keep creative control, retain subsidiary rights (audiobooks etc) and earn better economics. Self-published authors typically retain 50–70% of their book’s royalties.


Many self-published books that went on to be successful were considered too niche to be economically viable by traditional publishers. There’s also evidence that self-publishing is increasing diversity, as it improves publishing access from minority groups.


But self-publishing in its current form also has its problems. While self-publishing offers significant advantages compared to the traditional publishing model, it suffers from some drawbacks.


Drawbacks to Self-Publishing
Publishing through a traditional publisher usually means that authors get a cash advance, and the publisher bears the expense of editors, designers and marketing strategists. Thus, self-publishing requires significant up-front capital in order to hire the professionals necessary to get your book ready for market.


Crowdfunding might enable authors to battle some of these problems. But crowdfunding platforms typically charge high fees and offer limited returns for investors. This decreases overall participation and liquidity.


The Promise of Decentralized Books
Web3 has the potential to be the greatest improvement to the storytelling industry since the invention of the printing press. Over the last decade, financial markets have been trending towards inclusion and democratization of access. Huge numbers of successful start-ups have focused on providing ordinary retail investors the opportunity to invest in asset classes that have traditionally been reserved for the financial elite.


Crowdfunding books through the sale of security tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is an extension of that trend. NFTs enable people to invest in their favorite books and authors, while receiving robust property rights in return. Over the years, the success of those books & authors will be directly linked to the value of IP. Imagine investing in Harry Potter in its early years and receiving revenues from and characters in JK Rowling’s incredible fantasy universe.


Furthermore, investors will have access to more methods of monetization. Instead of waiting for royalty payments, investors will have the option to sell their IP rights in decentralized markets whenever they see fit. The infrastructure for such markets already exists.


Leveraging these technologies promises to create a much more vibrant and healthy market for publishing and crowdfunding than currently exists. However, web3 technologies do not just improve upon existing publishing methods. They offer whole new ways of creating dynamic, emergent IP that adapts and changes over time.&#x20;


Living Books
Most books today are written by a single author. But this is a relatively recent development. Our species’ oldest stories were passed down as oral traditions by generations of bards who each added their own creative flair to the story. Thus, many of the most important books in history like the Bible, the Iliad and the Odyssey were composed by many people over centuries. Their origins and authorship are therefore unknown and unknowable.


Web3 technology allows for similar cases of emergent collaborations while simultaneously providing the tools to attribute credit for various sections to their authors. This capability is likely to lead to a new generation of living books like the one you are currently reading which are the emergent result of collaboration and competition among the NFT holders mediated by market incentives.&#x20;


The US constitution is a perfect example of how this might work. It’s a powerful document built upon certain “self-evident” truths that proposed a new form of representative government by and for the people. This was a heretical idea in the days of absolute monarchy, and it went on to reshape Western Civilization. The Constitution was not written or decreed by a single individual. Instead, it was the end-result of the ideas of several founding fathers.


The document is the result of collaboration.


However, even the constitution had to be amended numerous times to better reflect the universal values it stood for. Today we believe that slavery and denying women the right to vote are inconsistent with the ideal “that all men are created equal”. The 13th and 19th amendments ironed out inconsistencies in the Constitution’s message and made it a better document. In total, the US constitution has been amended 27 times. Yet the process for amending the constitution is extremely difficult and time consuming.


While the underlying ideas of the constitution are universal, its systems are not.&#x20;


The world the founders lived in is very different from the world we live in today. In many ways the constitution is preventing meaningful reform on issues like mass shootings, women's right to abortion and the influence of money and PACs in politics. While the ideas espoused by the constitution were revolutionary. The methodology by which it is updated was constrained by the technology at the time.


Decentralized books through web3 technology have the potential to arrest a decades-long decline in the earnings of writers and supercharge a new literary golden age. Leveraging web3 technologies allows existing authors to find investors and contributors to their project who will help them finance and create the best version of their work while making money in the process.


Community-owned and edited IP promises to give control of NFT project lore and content back to the holders, creating better products in the process.


Ultimately, I believe that this technology will enable a new generation of DAO constitutions, powered by web3 and controlled by the community of holders. These constitutions can help to establish robust governance frameworks and enable DAOs to organize effectively in much the same way as the US constitution did for our government 250 years ago. More on this in a later section.&#x20;
