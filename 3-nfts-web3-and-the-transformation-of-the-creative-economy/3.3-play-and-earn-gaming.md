# Play and Earn Gaming

The gaming industry, a vibrant cornerstone of the entertainment sector, is witnessing an extraordinary period of growth, evolving into a favorite pastime for millions globally. A report from Morgan Stanley highlights the magnitude of this trend, revealing that a staggering 50 million Americans took up gaming in 2020—a remarkable 31% surge from the prior year. This meteoric rise has catapulted the video game market to new pinnacles, reaching an estimated valuation of $178.73 billion in 2021. This figure represents a substantial 14.4% increase from 2020, and with projections indicating a colossal value of $268 billion by 2025, the industry's ascent seems unstoppable.

Within this burgeoning field, free-to-play games have crystallized as the most dynamic segment, commanding over 85% of total revenues. These games, inviting users to download and embark on play without charge, also present opportunities for in-app purchases that enhance gameplay—whether leveling up characters or accelerating in-game tasks. Notable examples like Clash of Clans and Candy Crush have even earned the moniker of "pay to win" games due to the leverage wealthy players attain through in-game expenditures. However, it's essential to recognize that this model doesn't uniformly apply across all free-to-play games.

A case in point is Fortnite, the reigning titan among free-to-play games, which generates the bulk of its revenue through the sale of skins. TThese skins are purely aesthetic and do not confer any gameplay advantages. Instead, their appeal lies primarily in social expression and personalization. The widespread appeal of free-to-play games, coupled with the readiness of gamers to invest tangible currency in virtual goods, stands as testament to a thriving market environment.

Yet, beneath the surface of success lies a set of challenges that the current free-to-play model and the gaming industry must confront. A critical concern centers on the lack of genuine ownership granted to gamers regarding their in-game assets. An account's deletion or ban, often executed without transparent rationale or recourse, can lead to the irretrievable loss of valuable virtual possessions. This, in turn, disincentivizes considerable investments within the games, as players cannot easily resell these virtual commodities, nor retain their investments should they transition to a new game. Consequently, the gaming industry has traditionally been characterized by a one-sided relationship, where game developers and owners capture all the economic value and wield all the power.


The burgeoning trend of play-to-earn gaming, enabled by cutting-edge blockchain and web3 technologies, is transforming the traditional dynamics of the gaming industry, granting players unprecedented power and potential rewards. This innovative model bears resemblance to the familiar free-to-play gaming approach but distinguishes itself through one crucial aspect: in-game assets like weapons, items, and avatars, are instantiated as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), providing an entirely novel dimension to gameplay.

This NFT-based gaming paradigm bestows gamers with genuine ownership over their in-game assets, ensuring that these virtual possessions are both resellable and fully controlled by the owner. Such a mechanism introduces a liquidity to gaming previously unattainable in traditional frameworks. Whether driven by sudden financial needs or a desire to transition to a different game, players can conveniently sell their NFTs. Furthermore, this ownership structure not only compensates players but uniquely rewards early adopters who significantly contribute to a game's popularity and economic success.

The vitality of games, whether multiplayer experiences like Call of Duty or Fortnite or even single-player adventures, hinges on a robust player base. An insufficient flow of players can lead to extended waiting times for matches or lack of competition, undermining the game's allure. Moreover, a dedicated and expansive player pool enhances marketing strategies and extends a game's cultural reach, enticing more players. Without such an engaged community, funding for continual improvements could wither, leading to the game's eventual decline.

The transformative impact of the NFT ownership model extends beyond individual games, permeating the entire gaming industry. Generally, NFTs associated with lesser-known games may be more affordable than those linked to trending titles. However, this discrepancy in cost doesn't necessarily signal an inferior quality or diminished potential for virality. By endowing gamers with actual ownership of virtual assets, coupled with the prospect of financial appreciation, blockchain gaming motivates players to explore and promote overlooked or emerging games. If these hidden gems gain momentum, early adopters may reap substantial rewards from their escalating value.

The broader gaming community, in turn, flourishes through the discovery of fresh, high-quality gaming experiences. This ecosystem cultivates a virtuous cycle where players are incentivized to unearth and invest in promising titles, thus enriching the diversity and vibrancy of the gaming landscape.

Furthermore, capital appreciation, is not the only method of earning an economic return through blockchain gaming. Many play-to-earn games also provide players with the opportunity to earn additional NFTs and the game's native cryptocurrency by actively participating in gameplay. This revenue stream can be particularly significant for gamers in the developing world, especially in regions with low wages, high inflation, and a low cost of living, such as the Philippines and Venezuela. During the pandemic, play-to-earn games like Axie Infinity enabled millions of people who had lost their jobs or faced limited work opportunities to earn a living and support their families. One example is Juan Tirado, a 32-year-old unemployed Venezuelan, who shared, "Being able to play Axie has helped me pay off years of debts and cover not only my own food expenses but those of my daughter as well." While critics often highlight the potential volatility of in-game earnings due to cryptocurrency payments, this issue is less problematic in the developing world, where players' native currencies already suffer from high inflation. At least in play-to-earn gaming, the volatility of cryptos goes both ways, offering potential benefits alongside the risks.

Blockchain-based play-to-earn games, characterized by user ownership, are instigating a groundbreaking shift in the gaming industry, transitioning from a conventional "corporation-first" paradigm to a more inclusive and empowering "community-first" model. This transformative approach prioritizes the gamers, allocating a more substantial portion of the economic rewards to the players themselves, who have dedicated their time, energy, and resources to contribute to the game's triumph. It is a recognition that a game's greatness is ultimately determined by those who play it, with the market's judgment of quality manifested through gamers' investments of time and money.

In this progressive model, the traditional revenue streams are augmented by new avenues. Game developers still benefit through the initial sale of NFTs, which represent in-game assets, but they also gain a share of royalties from subsequent transactions. Additionally, they stand to profit from the appreciating value of their team's and treasury's token allocations should the game flourish. This innovative structure not only offers a more equitable distribution of rewards but also incentivizes developers to create engaging, fair, and balanced in-game economies.

When incentives are aligned correctly, these player-owned games can attain market capitalizations that dwarf what was achievable under the conventional, economically extractive gaming model. This community-centric approach fosters a shared sense of ownership and success, forging a more interactive and potentially lucrative connection that enriches the fabric of fandom. Gamers are no longer merely consumers; they become stakeholders, directly influencing and benefiting from the games they love.

The potential of blockchain gaming doesn't stop here. By harnessing innovative web3 technologies, such as decentralized constitutions described earlier, it opens up the frontier of emergent gameplay. Imagine a dynamic world where the game's foundational rules, enshrined in a "game constitution," are collaboratively owned and modified by the community. Ownership of the game's NFTs, coupled with active participation, would confer voting privileges, enabling gamers to have a voice in shaping the game's evolution.

This radical empowerment transforms players from passive recipients into active contributors, granting them the agency to partake in the decision-making process that guides the game's trajectory. Gone are the days of unilateral decisions by game developers; the community emerges as the nexus of governance, employing democratic principles to propose, discuss, and decide on enhancements, new features, and the overall direction of the game.

The effects of this approach extend far beyond mere governance. It engenders a profound sense of ownership, identification, and commitment among players, heightening the game's adaptability and sustainability. The game's constitution becomes more than a static document; it evolves into a living testament to the community's collective aspirations, ensuring that the game stays attuned to its players' ever-changing desires.

Moreover, by offering tangible incentives and recognizing contributions, this model encourages players to invest their intellectual capital, creativity, and passion. A thriving, collaborative ecosystem emerges, knitting together a tapestry of engaged players who take an active role in the game's continual growth and refinement.

In this burgeoning landscape, blockchain gaming reimagines the traditional creator-consumer dynamic, fostering a mutually beneficial partnership that blurs the boundary between developers and players. Embracing the ethos of decentralized governance, blockchain games cultivate a participatory culture, enabling the community's collective ingenuity to steer the course of the game. The result is a more resonant, immersive, and ever-evolving gaming experience, where players are not just on the field but in the game, shaping its destiny. This approach stands as a beacon for what gaming can be, a shared adventure guided by the community, for the community.

While play-to-earn games hold tremendous potential, a couple of challenges hinder the industry's growth. Firstly, the initial generation of play-to-earn games, like Axie Infinity, lacked the level of enjoyment desired by players. However, the remarkable success of these early games has attracted significant attention, capital, and game development talent to the space. As blockchain gaming companies receive more funding and entice experienced developers from traditional AAA gaming studios, the quality and appeal of the games will naturally increase. Therefore, while the first generation of blockchain games has been accurately described as play-to-earn, the second generation should evolve into play-and-earn games that offer enjoyable gameplay in itself, with the added bonus of potential substantial earning power. New games such as Sidus, Big Time, Imposters, and Star Atlas aim to achieve this objective. Furthermore, as the quality of blockchain games catches up with AAA studios, the superior economics and true ownership of in-game assets will make them more attractive to players, even if the game quality is slightly below that of traditional gaming.

The second challenge emanates from the skepticism and backlash faced by many traditional gaming studios when attempting to introduce NFTs and play-to-earn gaming. The gaming community often perceives such initiatives by AAA studios as cash grabs exploiting the popularity and user base of the games. For instance, Ubisoft and Discord, a community and messaging app primarily used by the gaming and NFT communities, encountered significant pushback when integrating NFTs and decentralized wallets into their services.

While these problems are substantial, they do not spell doom for the blockchain gaming industry. Continued development in the space appears poised to overcome these challenges. In this regard, the invention, development, and evolution of blockchain gaming mirror the adoption of many revolutionary inventions throughout history. New technologies often face resistance and fear from those attached to the status quo. The introduction of electricity to cities, the adoption of cars, and the development of the iPhone all encountered similar challenges. Incumbents have always propagated uncertainty and fear about new technologies in an attempt to limit their adoption and safeguard their market position. Similarly, users tend to be attached to the status quo and reluctant to switch to new and potentially superior technologies, as exemplified by business executives who once swore they would never give up their BlackBerrys.

Over the medium to long term, superior technology and economic systems prevail. As blockchain gaming rapidly improves, it will gradually attract users away from the traditional gaming industry, albeit initially at a slow pace. As these early adopters transition into blockchain gaming, the barriers to entry will diminish, and the overall gaming industry's understanding of the advantages of blockchain gaming will increase, enticing more users to join the movement. This process will accelerate over time as more members of the gaming community experiment with blockchain gaming and the quality of blockchain games continues to improve. 

The eventual disruption of the traditional gaming landscape by blockchain gaming isn't just a possibility; it appears to be an inevitable trend. It promises to forge new value, not only for the innovators and investors who are at the forefront of this wave but for the entire ecosystem of players, developers, and enthusiasts.

By acknowledging and addressing its challenges, and by learning from historical patterns of technological adoption, blockchain gaming can position itself as not merely an alternative but the next evolutionary step in the gaming industry. Its potential is not in replicating what has been done before but in creating a more participatory, rewarding, and democratic gaming experience. This exciting future, though fraught with challenges, holds the promise of reshaping gaming into a space where everyone has a stake and say in the worlds they explore and enjoy.
