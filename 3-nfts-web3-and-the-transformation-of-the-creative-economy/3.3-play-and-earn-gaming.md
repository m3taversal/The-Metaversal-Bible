# 3.3-Play and Earn Gaming
The gaming industry is experiencing unprecedented growth within the entertainment sector, with gaming becoming a popular pastime for millions of people. According to a Morgan Stanley report, a staggering 50 million Americans embraced gaming in 2020, representing a remarkable 31% increase from the previous year. This remarkable surge in interest has propelled the video game market to new heights, with an estimated worth of $178.73 billion in 2021, marking a significant 14.4% increase from 2020. The industry's growth shows no signs of slowing down, as recent forecasts predict that it will reach a staggering value of $268 billion by 2025.


Free-to-play games have emerged as the fastest-growing segment within the gaming industry, accounting for more than 85% of total revenues. These games offer users the ability to download and start playing for free, while providing opportunities for in-app purchases that enhance gameplay, such as leveling up characters or expediting in-game tasks. While some popular examples of free-to-play games like Clash of Clans, and Candy Crush have earned the label of "pay to win" games due to the advantage wealthy players gain through in-game purchases, not all free-to-play games offer this competitive advantage.


Fortnite, the largest and most valuable free-to-play game, generates the majority of its revenue from selling skins. These skins are purely aesthetic and do not confer any gameplay advantages. Instead, their appeal lies primarily in social expression and personalization. The popularity of free-to-play games and gamers' willingness to invest real money in virtual goods demonstrate the market's readiness to spend on these digital assets.


However, the current free-to-play model and the gaming industry as a whole face several challenges. One significant issue is that gamers do not have true ownership of their in-game assets. If their account gets deleted or banned, which often happens without clear explanations of why or avenues for appeal, they lose their valuable in-game assets with no means of recovery. Additionally, gamers cannot easily resell these virtual assets, disincentivizing substantial investments in these games. This makes sense as gamers lose their investment in these in-game assets if they decide to move on to a different game. Consequently, the gaming industry has traditionally been characterized by a one-sided relationship, where game developers and owners capture all the economic value and wield all the power.


However, the rise of play-to-earn gaming is reshaping this dynamic and empowering gamers. Play-to-earn models, enabled by blockchain and web3 technologies, provide an alternative approach where gamers can earn real economic value for their gameplay contributions.


Play-to-earn gaming introduces a new model that closely resembles free-to-play gaming, but with a significant difference: the in-game assets i.e. weapons, items, and avatars that players acquire are represented as NFTs. This innovative blockchain and NFT-based gaming model offers gamers true ownership over their in-game assets. Since these assets are NFTs, they become both resellable and controlled by the owner, providing a level of liquidity not typically found in traditional games. If an owner needs quick cash for unforeseen expenses or simply wants to move on from a specific game, they can easily sell their NFTs. This ownership model also rewards early adopters of popular games who play a significant role in driving a game's economic success.


For games to flourish and achieve economic success, they require a critical mass of players. Multiplayer games like Call of Duty or Fortnite, for example, rely on a large player base to ensure constant availability of matches. If player traffic is insufficient, new matches will suffer from long wait times and the game's appeal will diminish rapidly. Moreover, large and dedicated player pools serve as effective marketing strategies, expanding a game's social media presence and cultural appeal, thereby attracting even more players. Even single-player games require a critical mass of players to create an enjoyable and economically viable long-term experience. Without enough users, there is no one to compare performance with, and securing funding for further improvements and updates becomes challenging, potentially causing the game to fade away.


While the NFT ownership model offers significant advantages to both gaming studios and players within specific games, it also adds value to the gaming industry as a whole. As a general rule, NFTs of relatively unknown games will be less expensive than those of popular and trending games. Importantly, this doesn't imply lower quality or a lack of potential for these games to go viral and become extraordinarily popular. By granting gamers true ownership of virtual assets and avatars, and the potential for capital appreciation, the blockchain gaming model incentivizes players to actively seek out underappreciated games, acquire assets, and share them with their friends. In the event that these games gain traction, early adopters stand to benefit significantly from the increasing value of their investments. Ultimately, the gaming community as a whole benefits from the unearthing of another high-quality and popular gaming experience.


Capital appreciation, however, is not the only method of earning an economic return through blockchain gaming. Many play-to-earn games also provide players with the opportunity to earn additional NFTs and the game's native cryptocurrency by actively participating in gameplay. This revenue stream can be particularly significant for gamers in the developing world, especially in regions with low wages, high inflation, and a low cost of living, such as the Philippines and Venezuela. During the pandemic, play-to-earn games like Axie Infinity enabled millions of people who had lost their jobs or faced limited work opportunities to earn a living and support their families. One example is Juan Tirado, a 32-year-old unemployed Venezuelan, who shared, "Being able to play Axie has helped me pay off years of debts and cover not only my own food expenses but those of my daughter as well." While critics often highlight the potential volatility of in-game earnings due to cryptocurrency payments, this issue is less problematic in the developing world, where players' native currencies already suffer from high inflation. At least in play-to-earn gaming, the volatility of cryptos goes both ways, offering potential benefits alongside the risks.


Blockchain-based play-to-earn games, owned by their users, offer a transformative shift in the gaming industry from a "corporation first" to a "community first" model. In this model, a larger portion of the economic returns from successful games goes to the players who have invested their time and energy into that game, ultimately contributing to the gameâ€™s success. After all, a game can't be considered the best if nobody plays it. The market determines quality, and gamers vote with their time and money. Under this community-centric model, game developers generate revenues through the initial sale of NFTs, take a share of secondary royalties, and benefit from the appreciating value of their team and treasuries token allocations if the game thrives. By structuring incentives correctly and establishing a fair and valuable in-game economy, these player-owned games can achieve market capitalizations that were previously unattainable in the traditional economically extractive gaming model, creating more value for all participants.


Blockchain gaming has the potential to surpass its traditional counterparts by embracing the concept of emergence, facilitated by innovative web3 technologies such as decentralized constitutions described in the previous section. Envision a world where the rules of a game are established by a game constitution owned and edited by the community. By owning one of the game's NFTs and investing time into playing, gamers would gain editing and voting privileges, enabling them to collectively shape the game's future and evolution.


This revolutionary concept empowers players to actively participate in the decision-making process and influence the direction of the game. Instead of being subject to the unilateral decisions of game developers, the community becomes the driving force behind the game's governance. Through democratic consensus and transparent collaboration, gamers can propose, debate, and vote on changes and improvements to gameplay mechanics, features, and even the game's overall direction.


This community-driven approach not only fosters a sense of ownership and belonging among players but also enhances the game's adaptability and longevity. As the game constitution evolves through collective input, it becomes a living document that reflects the desires and aspirations of the community. This dynamic system ensures that the game remains engaging, relevant, and responsive to the evolving needs and preferences of its player base.


Furthermore, the integration of decentralized constitutions incentivizes players to actively contribute their time, knowledge, and creativity to the game. As players realize that their contributions directly impact the game's development, they become more invested in its success. This collaborative ecosystem nurtures a vibrant community of passionate players who actively shape the game's evolution and contribute to its growth.


In this emergent landscape, blockchain gaming revolutionizes the relationship between players and developers, establishing a symbiotic partnership that blurs the boundaries between creators and consumers. By embracing decentralized constitutions, blockchain games create a participatory environment where the collective wisdom and creativity of the community guide the game's destiny, resulting in richer, more engaging, and continuously evolving gaming experiences.


While play-to-earn games hold tremendous potential, a couple of challenges hinder the industry's growth. Firstly, the initial generation of play-to-earn games, like Axie Infinity, lacked the level of enjoyment desired by players. However, the remarkable success of these early games has attracted significant attention, capital, and game development talent to the space. As blockchain gaming companies receive more funding and entice experienced developers from traditional AAA gaming studios, the quality and appeal of the games will naturally increase. Therefore, while the first generation of blockchain games has been accurately described as play-to-earn, the second generation should evolve into play-and-earn games that offer enjoyable gameplay in itself, with the added bonus of potential substantial earning power. New games such as Sidus, Big Time, Imposters, and Star Atlas aim to achieve this objective. Furthermore, as the quality of blockchain games catches up with AAA studios, the superior economics and true ownership of in-game assets will make them more attractive to players, even if the game quality is slightly below that of traditional gaming.


The second challenge arises from the backlash faced by many traditional gaming studios when attempting to introduce NFTs and play-to-earn gaming. The gaming community often perceives such initiatives by AAA studios as cash grabs exploiting the popularity and user base of the games. For instance, Ubisoft and Discord, a community and messaging app primarily used by the gaming and NFT communities, encountered significant pushback when integrating NFTs and decentralized wallets into their services.


While these problems are substantial, they do not spell doom for the blockchain gaming industry. Continued development in the space appears poised to overcome these challenges. In this regard, the invention, development, and evolution of blockchain gaming mirror the adoption of many revolutionary inventions throughout history. New technologies often face resistance and fear from those attached to the status quo. The introduction of electricity to cities, the adoption of cars, and the development of the iPhone all encountered similar challenges. Incumbents have always propagated uncertainty and fear about new technologies in an attempt to limit their adoption and safeguard their market position. Similarly, users tend to be attached to the status quo and reluctant to switch to new and potentially superior technologies, as exemplified by business executives who once swore they would not give up their BlackBerrys.


Over the medium to long term, superior technology and economic systems prevail. As blockchain gaming rapidly improves, it will gradually attract users away from the traditional gaming industry, albeit initially at a slow pace. As these early adopters transition into blockchain gaming, the barriers to entry will diminish, and the overall gaming industry's understanding of the advantages of blockchain gaming will increase, enticing more users to join the movement. This process will accelerate over time as more members of the gaming community experiment with blockchain gaming and the quality of blockchain games continues to improve.&#x20;


In the long run, blockchain gaming will disrupt the traditional gaming space and create immense value for early adopters, investors, and innovators shaping the future of gaming.
