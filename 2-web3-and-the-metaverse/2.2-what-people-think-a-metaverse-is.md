# What People Think A Metaverse Is

##### Mark Zuckerberg - Meta Platforms
We will begin this discussion by examining Mark Zuckerberg’s vision of the metaverse. Zuckerberg is a relatively late entrant to the metaverse and stands apart from our other “experts” on the topic. However, his public vote of confidence in the future of the metaverse and household name recognition make his beliefs a good place to start. According to Zuckerberg, “we are at the beginning of the next chapter for the internet.” Technological improvement, greater connectivity and faster internet connections have created a new and more valuable future for the internet. As such, “the next platform will be even more immersive - an embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it. We call this the metaverse, and it will touch every product we build. The defining quality of the metaverse will be a feeling of presence - like you are right there with another person or in another place. Feeling truly present with another person is the ultimate dream of social technology. That is why we are focused on building this. In the metaverse, you’ll be able to do almost anything you can imagine - get together with friends and family, work, learn, play, shop, create - as well as completely new experiences that don’t really fit how we think about computers or phones today.”

While this vision of the metaverse is largely in line with other leaders in the space, Mark Zuckerberg’s actual approach is more worrying. Facebook’s pivot to focusing on building out the metaverse is an attempt to gain a first mover advantage and capitalize on network effects. When Facebook acquired Oculus, Zuckerberg said that Facebook wanted “to start building the next major computing revolution that will come after mobile” and that there are not many candidates for this next major computing platform. The Oculus investment is essentially a “long-term bet on the future of computing… immersive virtual and augmented reality will become a part of people’s everyday life.”

While many companies want to take part in the emerging metaverse, Facebook wants to dominate it. Zuckerberg intends to host the metaverse on a platform completely controlled by Facebook because “history suggests that there will be more platforms to come, and whoever builds and defines these [will shape the future and reap the benefits].” Unfortunately, a metaverse dominated by Facebook is likely to be quite dystopian, with extremely high fees, pervasive targeted advertising, nonexistent virtual property rights and no user control over nor monetization of their data. In fact, Facebook has already announced that they will be taking a 47.5% cut on digital assets and services in their virtual reality platform, Horizon World.

#### Tim Sweeney - Epic Games
In contrast, the CEO of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney wants to create an open metaverse in which assets are freely transferable across different metaverse platforms and developers and creators have more control. Sweeney “envisions the Metaverse as an expansive, communal & virtual world where people can interact with brands, intellectual properties, and each other within experiences spanning across all categories (beyond gaming). Over the coming decades, he believes the evolving “metaverse has the potential to become a multi-trillion-dollar part of the world economy.” However, in order for the metaverse to become an extremely valuable part of the global economy and additive to people’s lives it cannot be controlled by a few gatekeepers charging extortionate fees and stifling innovation. These are sentiments we share.

This belief has been a factor in motivating Epic Games legal battles with Apple and Google over the 30% fees that both platforms charge on their app stores which are anticompetitive and overly burdensome to developers.

Currently, Sweeney believes there are “about 600 million people playing metaverse types of experiences socially with their friends.” This is important because Sweeney feels that metaverse aspiring companies like Epic, Roblox, Facebook and Microsoft are in a race to reach a billion users because “whoever brings on a billion users first, would be the presumed leader in setting the standards.” 

In an effort to build out their user base and lead by example, Epic games is opening up its platforms to user generated content. For example, Fortnite Creative is a suite of tools that enables anybody to build their own Fortnite island. This initiative has yielded powerful results. Now “about half of Fortnite play time by users is now in content created by others, and half is in Epic content.” Moreover, this is just the beginning. Epic Games plans to release the Unreal Editor for Fortnite, which will open up content creation so that “anybody can build very high quality game content and code… and deploy it into Fortnite without having to deal with us - its open to everybody.” Additionally, Epic Games intends to use Unreal Engine more generally to “give everybody the 3D real-time content creation tools they need to bring content into the metaverse.” 

Rather than extracting money from creators Epic Games will profit alongside creatives from opportunities as they emerge.

#### Dave Baszucki - Roblox
Like Sweeney, Dave Baszucki has dreamed about creating and inhabiting the metaverse for a long time. This vision goes all the way back to Buszucki and his late co-founder Eric Cassel’s first company, Knowledge Revolution, which built educational software that allowed people to run interactive lessons and physics experiments. Watching people build and create stuff catalyzed the idea for Roblox - a platform focused on building out the metaverse. Roblox has been very successful, boasting 43 million daily active users, a vibrant developer community and a rich content economy. As Baszucki explains, he and his cofounder shared a vision “of this future category, sometimes called the metaverse. We think of it as the human co-experience category that supports people coming together to socialize, to learn, to play, [and] someday to work to experience entertainment and amazing brands.”

In Baszucki’s opinion, a true metaverse must have something like 8 different characteristics. First, you have to be able to embody an avatar with a virtual identity and have full creative expression over what your avatar looks like. Second, you have to be able to make “friends with real people and socialize in the metaverse.” Third, the metaverse must be “immersive” in that it causes you “lose your sense of reality” and makes you “feel like you’re somewhere else.” Fourth, “you should be able to log in from anywhere,” regardless of where you live or what culture you are from. This means low-latency wireless connections have to be built out to enable large swaths of the developing world to access the metaverse. Fifth, the metaverse should be low friction enabling its users to go “anywhere instantly.” If you are in the middle of a class about the ancient Greek olympics, you should be able to transport yourself to ancient Greece to watch historically accurate renditions of the event. Sixth and seventh, a metaverse needs to contain a vibrant economy with a large variety of content to allow developers both to make a living by creating content for the metaverse and to give users a constant supply of new things to experience and digital goods to buy. Finally, a metaverse should improve “digital civility” allowing users to come together in “safety and stability” without the inflammatory personal attacks and diatribes that internet anonymity often leads to.

Now let’s move from the opinions of entrepreneurs involved in building the metaverse to those of a Venture Capitalist focused on funding metaverse companies.

#### Matthew Ball - Venture Capitalist and author
Matthew Ball has written a number of illuminating blog posts on the subject, is the author of the book The Metaverse and is considered one of the world’s foremost experts on the subject. According to Ball, “the Metaverse is best understood as ‘a quasi-successor state to the mobile internet.’ This is because the Metaverse will not fundamentally replace the internet, but instead build upon and iteratively transform it” just as the mobile internet did to the internet of the 1960s to 1990s. Today, a huge majority of daily internet traffic is sent through mobile devices. The growth of the mobile internet has revolutionized how, when, where and why we use the internet, transforming our lives, politics and business models in the process. Despite this the evolution of the mobile internet “did not change the underlying architecture of the internet” which is still primarily transmitted through and managed by the same fixed infrastructure.

Ball believes that the Metaverse will be a similarly transformative event to the development of the mobile internet. As this revolution progresses, he believes it will alter “the role of computers and the internet in our lives.” During the era of the fixed line internet, people had to purchase personal computers and they could only access the internet from their house. With the rise of the mobile internet and the proliferation of connected devices most people gained continuous access to computation and connectivity. Ball believes the Metaverse will take this process “further by placing everyone inside an ‘embodied’ or ‘virtual’ or ‘3D’ version of the internet on a nearly unending basis.” Instead of merely having access to the internet, “we will constantly be ‘within’ the internet.” Moreover, as the Internet of Things, the number of connected devices and the processing power of our technology continues to expand exponentially our real world will become ever more enmeshed in our digital one and vice versa. Thus Matthew Ball offers his best swing at a definition:

“The Metaverse is a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments.”

Despite the thoughts of these illuminating - and some not so illuminating - thought leaders, many people feel the concept of the metaverse is still somewhat hazy. The recent explosion of interest in the metaverse and related concepts has resulted in the term being used to describe a wide range of technologies and phenomena that are not in fact metaverses. We shall try and illuminate this topic more in the next section.
