# Web3, Decentralization and the Metaverse

Now you might be thinking, the metaverse sounds all well and good but what does this have to do with NFTs and cryptocurrency?


The easiest way to intuitively grasp the value of NFTs is through a story.


During the early days of Facebook, the company was focused on growth above all else. After the platform had finished spreading through college campuses, Facebook focused on onboarding the general public. To accomplish this, their primary scaling strategy was building partnerships with well-known brands.


Facebook hired hundreds of sales reps who convinced businesses of all types to build brand Facebook pages on their site. Their message was simple: "Build big communities and you will own them" (The Four). This pitch led many brands to jump on this opportunity to develop a better connection with their customer base and avoid having to pay broadcasting companies or news outlets for advertising. Consequently, wide array of brands invested hundreds of millions into building out huge branded communities on Facebook. Facebook in turn benefited enormously from the herculean quantities of free advertising these brands generated by urging their consumers to "like" their brands Facebook page.


Thousands of small and medium businesses and startups also leveraged Facebook to reach and connect with their customers. Businesses and individuals like bloggers, indie bands, non-profits, community theatres, artists, photographers, food trucks just to name a few built out brand pages on Facebook.


This was the golden age of Facebook. The eclectic mix of small businesses and purpose oriented Facebook pages generated much of the content and variety that made browsing Facebook fun in the early days. You could find a wealth of interesting content, ideas, people and businesses just by scrolling through your facebook feed. Value on the early Facebook platform accrued to the edges - to the users, blogs and small businesses of all shapes and sizes.


However, free or discounted services never stay free for long when you are at the mercy of a platform, promises or no promises. As Facebook scaled, its relationship with the individuals and businesses that collectively built Facebook and made it valuable changed. Users and businesses alike began to notice that the organic reach of their posts was dropping like a stone.


During the early days of Facebook, the percentage of a brand's posts that showed up on a fan's feed - the organic reach of brand's content - was around 100%. This makes perfect sense. Fan's had liked these brand's Facebook pages so that they would receive posts from the brand. However, beginning in 2012 Facebook fan pages began noticing something strange. Their organic reach was shrinking. Posts were getting fewer and fewer clicks. In response to a community outcry, Facebook acknowledged that it had tweaked its feed algorithm. This "tweak" meant that brand messages now reached only 15 percent of an account's fans on average.


Fortunately, Facebook had a solution to this distressing turn of events. Pay them for access. In the wake of the algorithm change Gokul Rajaram, Facebook's head of advertising explained that if you want the other 80 to 85 percent of people who liked your page (to get your content) to see your posts, "sponsoring posts is important"[ https://observer.com/2012/09/broken-on-purpose/](https://observer.com/2012/09/broken-on-purpose/).


Over the next couple years the organic reach of Brand pages continued to drop like a stone, declining 49% from October 2013 to February 2014. Even more brazenly, Facebook sources unofficially began advising community managers to expect organic reach to approach zero in the foreseeable future (Facebook Zero, social@Ogilvy).

Whether these changes to the Facebook algorithm were related to Facebook's bungled IPO which declined from an opening price of $36 a share in May 2012 to $18 a share by September is impossible to know. But by late 2012, Sponsored Stories was raking in almost $1 million dollars a day for Facebook. Facebook had turned a "problem" with their algorithm into a cash cow.


Whether the changes to the Facebook algorithm were motivated by Facebook's poor stock market performance or whether the neutering of organic reach was always Facebook's long-term plan is almost irrelevant. The point is Facebook had a financial incentive to break their feed algorithm and so they did. People who built their livelihoods around Facebook were betrayed[ https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303740704577521072755665762](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303740704577521072755665762). This example is symptomatic of a larger endemic problem with social media platforms.


"It doesn't end with Facebook... Being broken pays off, so social media is often deliberately broken. In fact, nearly every major social network, site or app has greedily pursued this logic," explains ex social media strategist and current best-selling author Ryan Holiday.


The power and propensity that centralized platforms have to change the rules of the game once they achieve mass adoption is one of the largest problems with the current structure of the internet. In fact, the incentives are so strong that centralized platforms conform to a predictable lifecycle. As Chris Dixon explains:


"At first they do everything they can to recruit users and third-party complements like creators, developers, and businesses.&#x20;


They do this to strengthen their network effect. As platforms move up the adoption S-curve, their power over users and third parties steadily grows.

When they hit the top of the S-curve, their relationships with network participants change from positive-sum to zero-sum. To continue growing requires extracting data from users and competing with (former) partners.


Famous examples of this are Microsoft vs. Netscape, Google vs. Yelp, Facebook vs. Zynga, Twitter vs. its third-party clients, and Epic vs. Apple.


For third parties, the transition from cooperation to competition feels like a bait-and-switch. Over time, the best entrepreneurs, developers, and investors have learned to not build on top of centralized platforms. This has stifled innovation."


The problems with the current internet have created a growing movement to reinvent the basic architecture of the internet and platforms and enshrine the decentralization of ownership and control at the core of the new protocol. This movement is called web3 and it is the focus of the next section.
